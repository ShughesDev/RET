# Basic Tutorial

## Release Notes

This basic tutorial on the use of the Rapid Exploratory modelling Toolset (RET) was written in Python 3.8 and using
`ret` v1.0

## Structure

This tutorial is written as a series of jupyter notebooks which are designed to be followed in order.  They are written
to provide new users of RET with a basic understanding of the core components of the framework and to provide a logical
order in which to approach a basic combat modelling task.  As this is a basic tutorial we will not be creating new agent
types or significantly modifying behaviours (examples of this can be found in the advanced tutorial).  Details of the
scenario are not strictly necessary for this tutorial but can be found in a separate notebook.
